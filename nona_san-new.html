<p class="box1" style="border-radius: 7px;">String along side Noëlla while she travels around the
  neopian world -and beyond- by stepping through a swirly magical portal hidden somewhere in the
  haunted woods.<br>
  Will it hurt, you seem to wonder... Yet do not be alarmed, for I have seen her
  come and go through that mysterious thing countless times without even the slightest harm. *wink* <br>
  So! What do you say to adventures ?

    Noëlla prefers to take some time to observe quietly any new creature while being hidden before deciding if she'll approach or not.
    She is really curious, but also quite cautious and fearful so she might choose to run away before being seen.<br>
    Once she decides to get close though, she'll love you forever no matter where you are or how often you meet.<br>
    She's also very cuddly towards her particularly close friends and family.

   <h4>ORIGIN STORY</h4>

   <p><b>EARLY MEMORIES</b><br>
      Unlike her partner Noulfe, Noëlla doesn't have much nice memories of growing up in a loving family.
      She does however remember having to fight to survive in her early days. She had always been rather small for a xweetok,
      even as a baby and that is why she had been able to hide well enough to stay alive when a rabbid gryffon attacked
      and ate her entire family clan. After staying hidden, trembling and absolutely terrified for her life, she fled
      the place and began fighting to keep moving, and searching for food wherever she could find.<br>
      As she started to approach cities, she did find it easier to get scraps from the garbage there, and also hidden
      places to get some kind of shelter form the rain and cold, but she was constantly fearful and wouldn't rest for long anywhere.
      Most of her memories from that awful time is blurred in her mind now, but she remembers perfectly how she used to feel...<br>
      One day, and she won't ever forget it, a wonderful person lent her a helpful hand and rescued her by getting her off the streets as well as
      back to proper health. After that she became stronger, a bit more confident and was able to return to a normal xweetok life,
      by going back in the wild.<br>
      She would then soon decide to live in the haunted woods, where our main story is about to begin.
   </p>
   <p><b>CATALYST EVENT</b><br>
      The main event that changed her, and started this whole story, is Noëlla's dicovery of a strange swirly glowing magic portal.
      This magical thing is used to travel instantly to many places all over the world, and maybe even beyond, but Noëlla hasn't
      discovered that yet.<br>
      She did however learnt how to use that portal and it has brought a lot more happiness to her.<br>
      Before she found it, she was mainly hiding deep in the woods, but since then, she has been able to visit so many amazing
      places, and has met countless new friends, including everyone she's currently living with!
   </p>
   <p><b>BELIEF SYSTEM</b></br>
      Having her world made a little less scary and unwelcoming by the help of a stranger, Noëlla strongly believes in
      helping others, like she's been helped and rescued. Being a nice "person" is very important to her.

   </p>

   <br><br><br>
   <h3 style="border-radius: 0 20px 20px 0;">Prologue</h3>
   <h4>Prologue</h4>

   <p>
      « Woooh! » Another tiny ghost petpet flies through Noëlla as she shivers, still startled by the intrusion inside of her.<br>
      « I might need to change my plans and decide to live somewhere else after all, she thinks to herself. I don't think I'll ever get used to
      these tiny body passing-through creatures... But for now I should still try to find the perfect tree to make my home into,
      even if it is just a temporary home. »
   </p>
   <p>
      Noëlla is a young xweetok, and she has decided that the haunted woods would be the perfect place for her to settle safely. She had a rough
      time for a while battling for whatever food she could find in garbage cans of the big cities, but after being rescued by a lovely soul,
      she is back in the wild and looking for a more quiet life. Sure xweetoks enjoy lively companions, chasing them in games of tag and all,
      but one needs a feeling of calm and safety to be able to sleep at peace. Forever more, most xweetoks find themselves scattered in all corners
      of Neopia now, so it has become hard for them to find such companions, and they often have to travel for ages before they encounter another xweetok,
      or group of xweetok, as they still generally live in groups, even if those are nothing in comparison with the massive original xweetok community
      back in the Xweetok Forest ages ago... But I digress, let’s get back to our young little hero now.
   </p>
   <p>
      Ah! There she is, jumping from one tree to another, very gracefully, and high enough to be out of range to any werewolf or other dangerous folk
      lurking in those woods. After every few jumps she’s stopping, listening attentively, on alert for noises indicating a ferocious presence.
      She wouldn’t want to end up as some hungry beast’s dinner, now would she? And when she is reassured, has sniffed in the air and looked in every
      directions, she starts jumping again hoping to find the perfect tree.<br>
      So far she has been sleeping on ok trees, but has not been really fully satisfied by any of them.
   </p>
   <p>
      What is a perfect tree you ask? Well that is a very good question! For a lonely xweetok it is quite different from the trees they choose when
      they live in large groups. The best protection you want when you are alone is a perfect camouflage, in order to remain undetected when you are
      sleeping of course. This means either a massive cover of leaves (but you can’t find much leafy trees in the haunted woods, can you?) or a tree
      with very intricate branches forming a tiny hiding spot, or even some hollow tree with a big enough hole in it (now there are plenty of these trees here!).
   </p>
   <p>Oh look! I think she has found one.</p>
   <p>
      Noëlla is now on a big tree, circling around the trunk and climbing high in the branches, until she reaches the tangled intersection of branches she had spotted.<br>
      « I can make something decent here » she thinks.<br>
      As soon as she’s decided, she begins to remove all the dead leaves piled in the little cup made by the branches. She keeps them around as they will serve
      to cover her once she curls up in a tiny ball. She believes it’s always better to be extra careful. After a few minutes, she settles inside her hiding hole and
      begins to fall asleep…
   </p>
   <p>
      She prefers to sleep during the day and keep moving at night, simply because her night vision is much better than her daylight one. Her fur is also
      a lot more discrete in the moon light, so she has less risks of being seen.
   </p>
   <p>
      After a few minutes, her ears raise up picking up a very strange bouncy noise. Boing!<br>
      « What is that? I’ve never heard this kind of sound inside the woods. » Starting to feel unsecure, she looks around to try and find what made it. All she can see
      are the little ghosts, flying purposelessly as usual.<br>
      Wait, here it is again. Boing! How peculiar. This time she definitely found from which direction it was coming. “Should I try to go back to sleep?
      No, it could be a terrible danger coming towards me, I must see what this is and prepare to run away.” And so she starts stretching her paws,
      rounding her back and shaking away the sleepiness. Moving as slowly and silently as possible, she advances in the direction she heard the noise,
      still unable to see what could possibly have made it.<br>
      And then, once again, much closer: boing! Now she has seen it clearly. One of the mini ghosts just bounced off something. But what does it mean?
      Aren’t they supposed to pass through anything, including living people? It doesn’t make any sense at all.<br>
      As she reaches the bouncing point, she still can’t see what there is here. Until she touches a tinkling invisible wall. Extremely surprised,
      she jumps backwards, with her hair all up and electric.<br>
      « What is that? » Her nose is sniffing all she can, but that is not helping at all.<br>
      « One paw maybe. » She tries to reach the mysterious invisible thing in front of her, but only seems to strike the air. As she keeps moving forward,
      she realizes that when another ghost reaches it without passing (boing!) it becomes slightly tangible and visible at the point of impact. <br>
      She tries to touch it very carefully and her paw just goes through, with that tinkling again! Apparently ghosts cannot pass, but she can. So she does.
      And there, beyond the barrier, she finds a perfectly preserved bubble of nature, with trees entirely covered in leaves, grass, flowers and everything woods
      are supposed to be like if they are not haunted or cursed. A little heavenly corner in the middle of the haunted woods!<br>
      « I should sleep here! No ghostly intrusion during my nap time, this is perfect! Maybe werewolves cannot go through either. I should make sure of that,
      but for now, let’s find a nice and high spot to go back to sleep in. » And there she goes, up in a beautiful tree, hidden by countless leaves,
      she feels absolutely safe, like she hasn’t in days. And as fast as this, she falls back asleep.
   </p>
   <p>But she hasn’t noticed the unnatural bright blue light going on just underneath her…</p>

        <br><b>➜</b> Noëlla lives in the woods (she's a xweetok after all). The haunted woods were
        the only woods available as a place to live when I created her (many years ago!) and since
        then I have been willing to create a mashup of clouds and spooky trees. <i>Purple and blue are
        two of my favorite colors and when combined they are like eye candy to me.</i>
        <br><b>➜</b> Noëlla eats mainly acorns, nuts and berries, plus occasionelly mushrooms and other plants.
        She is a peaceful creature that does not harm others for no reason. This is probably the reason why
        usuls and xweetoks get along so well, just as with cybunnies, ixis, and many other foresty pets
        (but not so well with lupes, kougras or any predatory species).
        <i>I am basing this on the default xweetok petpage information and pictures.</i>
        <br><b>➜</b> Noëlla likes to travel and explore new lands because she is very curious and loves to learn new things
        (while still advising caution towards the unknown). She uses a magic portal -<i>TO DO: figure out
        how it works and how she found it</i>- to quickly go to amazing places far away <i>(why not Purled's island?)</i> and remain
        able to get back home as fast as may be needed. <i>Therefore access to magic is required in this story, but I am not
        convinced about neopet's faerie magic and would prefer either a witchy encounter, or even
        maybe an older ancient kind of magic.</i>
        <br><b>➜</b> I am not sure about the clothing situation, because I like my pets being
        animals and clothes are probably just limiting their movements and capacities in nature-like
        environnements such as a forest (which they live in). I might just get some more for the fun of playing
        with neopets customization, and not represent these in my characters pictures and stories.
        However, I do like little accessories such as jewelry and face props even if they might
        not be really practical (not wigs though, my pet are not humans).

      <td colspan="2"><p class="box2" style="font: 10pt 'Tahoma';">My base world is Neopia, maybe in an old
        time when most of the land is still covered by forests? With an abondance of fruits, berries and nuts.
        <br><b>➜</b>"the Xweetok Forest Time": They were so many of them! And all thriving. (NOELLA DOES NOT REMEMBER THIS TIME)<br>
        Xweetoks are social creatures : thousands of xweetoks, all living in harmony with nearly unlimited resources
        (food, water, shelters and lively compagnonship, which they really enjoy). <br>
        Older xweetoks were very respected for their wisdom, and all the advices they gave while "guiding" the very large flocks.
        This enormous community was formed by smaller family clans established a few trees away from each other.
        Everyone was welcome and also encouraged to go explore outside their own nest, knowing that they would always have a place
        to return to whenever they would feel the need to. <br>
        The family bonds are very strong between xweetoks. They last all their life.<br>
        <br><b>➜</b>"Nowadays": Now eveything is different and there are deserts, swamps, and many cities crowded with a lot of people
        sometinmes waging wars against one another!<br>
        Today the xweetoks are scaterred all over Neopia, with some even living in the cities, but since they are
        small preyed on and rather timid creatures, most of them have retired out of the plains and deaper into either
        the lower levels of mountains or the few forests left.<br>
        Since there isn't one very large group of xweetoks anymore, but instead a multitude of tiny family cells everywhere,
        it has become more difficult and dangerous for xweetoks to survive. They don't have access to the ancestral knowledge
        of their elders like they used to and each one is basicly just responsable for themselves, unless they have created a family.
        Being extremely found of company, many have found companions that aren't of the same species. This offers a better
        protection against the numerous predators out there.<br>
        <br><b>➜</b>"Our story": Noëlla found or established her home in the haunted woods. She thought that since theese were mostly inhabited
        by dead (harmless?) things (and therefore scary for a lot people that would not get into those woods),
        she could probably be quite safe (always keeping a vigilant eye on those scary werewolves, though).<br>
        There is not so much food in the haunted woods because of the conditions the trees are in,
        so Noëlla spends a lot of time exploring beyond them and searching for new fruit trees and bushes.
        This is slowly leading her further and further away from their home tree where she lives with her partner Noulfe and their
        kit/cub (Taluk). They are installed with a very close usul friend (Plume) who just recently gave birth to her
        baby (no name chosen yet), and there is a bunny (Maënna) living with them (or on/in the grounds below them more precisely).
        <i>-plus also a future cloud jubjub, when I am done playing with the lab-</i><br>
        They get along perfectly within this little familial cell.
        <i>Xweetoks are after all some kind of mix between squirrels (like usuls) cats/foxes (that tail!)
        and rabbits (cybunnies).</i><br>
        While Noëlla is away looking for food, Maënna and Plume are trying to revive the woods and give back more life
        (starting with some more leaves!) to the bushes and trees around where they live. They use potions, spells and all the magic
        they can find.<br>

          <b>➜</b>Noëlla's family has 2 levels. The first one is tied by the everlasting bonds that are created
          within a xweetok family clan. Ever since she randomly met Noulfe, they have been inseparable, and with Taluk the newest member of the clan,
          their bond just keeps tightening. They will often spend hours sleeping in a big pile of their three lushious furry coats.
          -<i>I need to find out if drawing this is against the rules</i>-<br>
          The second level of Noëlla's family is made of very close friends that will come to feel very much like a group of brother and sisters,
          providing an amazing support to Noulfe and Noëlla. In return, they are being protected by the two xweetoks.<br>
          Plume was having a really difficult time and Noëlla helped her the best she could. As a result, Plume came to live with the three xweetoks.
          She soon after gave birth to her very own baby, and is happy to count as member of this family, even if she is still
          very reserved sometimes.<br>
          Maënna has met Noëlla when she was looking for magic ideas on how to improve the health of trees in the haunted woods. She had never
          heard of those weird trees, and decided to follow Noëlla back home in order to study the mystery and hope to find a solution.
          She has a great knowledge in magical potions and plants, so she'll be their guide and mentor in all magical things.<br>
          Zouen, the cloud jubjub (not present yet) is actually Maënna's former teacher and mentor. She will turn to him for advice and he will
          chose to come also. He's a bit annoying for Noëlla, with a general know-it-all attitude.<br>
          <b>➜</b>Concerning rivalries, Noëlla only has a few. Zouen isn't really as bad as she first thought, and she'll come to appreciate
          him more with time. She's more annoyed than really bullied by the tiny malicious dark faeries floating around in the forest and by the
          numerous ghosts frequently passing through every thing and every one.<br>
          There is that distant water xweetok relative who has been growing up far and alone, and therefore is rather unfriendly and bad
          mannered, but he isn't in the story either for the moment.<br>
          The main source of anger and stress for Noëlla is her fear of gryffons as she's had a very frightening experience as a young xweetok.
          That fear extends to any big and ferocious creature, or any predator that might harm her family.
